# hiding_speak
A silly little script I made to take advantage of spoilers on Discord. This script will prompt the user for text and then return the same text with each letter spoilered and wrapped as a code block (for monospacing). Functions for emotes and wraps them correctly in spoilers. This script does not account for italicized or underlined text.
